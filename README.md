# A whole lifespan mouse multi-tissue DNA methylation clock


Raw reads (RRBS, Illumina HiSeq, 150PE) were trimmed using Trim Galore v0.4.1. The filtered reads were mapped to the mouse genome (GRCm38/mm10) using Bismark v0.15.0.





Making_WLMT.py was used to create a whole lifespan mouse multi-tissue DNA methylation clock base on DNA methylation level dataframes created in the previous scripts.
